*Note:* the "AA contrast" columns refers to the fact that the five main colors have a contrast of at least 4.5:1, assuming that the font size in the text editor is going to be small. At 3:1, *i.e.* for larger font sizes or bold fonts, all colors in all themes have AA contrast (with the exception of the clear sand color in *Seaside* at 2.98).
