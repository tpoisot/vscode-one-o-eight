# One o Eight

| Theme   | background |  main colors                      |
| ------- | ---------- |  -------------------------------- |
| Light   | light      |  purple, blue, green, orange, red |
| Dark    | dark       |  purple, blue, green, orange, red |
| Calm    | light      |  purple, blue, green              |
| Forest  | light      |  brown, green                     |
| Seaside | light      |  blue, teal, sand                 |

Note that all main colors in all schemes have a contrast of at least 7:1 to their background, corresponding to an AAA accessibility contrast. This doesn't mean that the colors have strong differences from one another (most do), but that the contrast between the colors and the background is sufficient (and relatively homogeneous).
